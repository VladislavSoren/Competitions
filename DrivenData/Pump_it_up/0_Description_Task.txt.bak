Goal: 
To predict the operating condition of a waterpoint for each record in the dataset.

Distribution of Labels:
	functional 				- the waterpoint is operational and there are no repairs needed
	functional needs repair - the waterpoint is operational, but needs repairs
	non functional 			- the waterpoint is not operational
